## Introduction

[Jacked](https://github.com/carbonetes/jacked) provides organizations with a more comprehensive look at their application to take calculated actions and create a better security approach. Its primary purpose is to scan vulnerabilities to implement subsequent risk mitigation measures.

This jenkins plugin scans a given target and expose vulnerability.

- `Tar File`: Provide the target tar file path to be scanned.
- `SBOM File`: Provide the target [Diggity](https://github.com/carbonetes/diggity) JSON Format SBOM file path to be scanned.

### Skip Build Fail
Default value is `false / unchecked`.
<br>
<b>Warning:</b> If the value is checked, it will restrict the plugin from failing the build based on the assessment result.

### Skip Database Update
Default value is `false / unchecked`.

## Usage as Pipeline
```sh
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Jacked Scan') {
            steps {
                script {
                    jacked scanType: 'image',           // Choose Scan Type: image, directory, tar, or sbom.
                    scanName: 'ubuntu',                 // Input: Image name, Directory path, tar file path, or sbom file path.
                    severityType: 'high',               // Select a threshold that will fail the build when equal to or above the severity found in the results. 
                                                        // Severity: critical, high, medium, low, negligible, unknown.
                    skipFail: false,                    // Default as false. Skip build to fail based on the assessment.
                    skipDbUpdate: false                 // Default as false. Skip Database Update when scanning.
