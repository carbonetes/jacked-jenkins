# Jacked

## Introduction
<br>
[Jacked](https://github.com/carbonetes/jacked) provides organizations with a more comprehensive look at their application to take calculated actions and create a better security approach. Its primary purpose is to scan vulnerabilities to implement subsequent risk mitigation measures.

This jenkins plugin scans a given target and expose vulnerability.

## Getting started

This jenkins plugin installs jacked binary tool in the job workspace directory and performs scan. 
## Auto-install & Update Binary [Jacked](https://github.com/carbonetes/jacked)
The plugin will install the "jacked" binary tool. `(Windows and Linux Supported)`
- Auto-update: If checked, the binary will automatically update when a new release is available.
- Uses Scoop for Windows
- Uses Shell Script for Linux

# Output
Provides the following:
- `Quiet Mode`: Removed verbiage.
- Show a list of packages.
- `Analyzing BOM`: Showing vulnerabilities found and providing recommendations to fix them.
- Show CI Assessment Result: Pass or Fail based on the selected fail criteria severity type.
- Saves output file on the workspace in every build. `jacked_result_$(JOBNAME)_$(BUILDNUMBER).txt`

# Usage as Pipeline
```sh
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Jacked Scan') {
            steps {
                script {
                    jacked scanType: 'image',           // Choose Scan Type: image, directory, tar, or sbom.
                    scanName: 'ubuntu',                 // Input: Image name, Directory path, tar file path, or sbom file path.
                    severityType: 'high',               // Select a threshold that will fail the build when equal to or above the severity found in the results. 
                                                        // Severity: critical, high, medium, low, negligible, unknown.
                    skipFail: false,                    // Default as false. Skip build to fail based on the assessment.
                    skipDbUpdate: false,                // Default as false. Skip Database Update when scanning.
                    ignorePackageNames: '',             // Ignore Package names when scanning... e.g. input: dpkg,tar,bash,...
                    ignoreCves: ''                      // Ignore CVES when scanning... e.g. input: CVE-2022-1271,CVE-2022-3715,CVE-2022-1664,...
                }
